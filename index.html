      <h2>Hello World!</h2><br>
      My name is Karin and I'm 31 years old. I recently completed an internship as a web developer and before that I have worked
      administratively for several years. As a web developer, I got the chance to nurture my interest in programming. I am very
      fond of both the structured and logical aspect of programming, as well as of the more problem-solving and developing side.
      But that it's always possible to learn more, that you'll never be finished learning, is the most intriguing part for me!
      During my internship I worked in a smaller team, which I was very pleased with. The opportunity to be able to both work
      alone and also collaborate and bounce ideas off each other, was something I greatly appreciated.<br>
      <br>
      My administrative role has consisted of everything from case management to more complex assignments regarding procurement
      and administrative coordination between different departments. I really liked the ability to work both with tasks essential
      for the company, and with larger projects dealing a great deal with coordination and evolving an ability to quickly get an
      overview. To me it felt essential to have knowledge of all levels of the company in order to be able to do a good job and
      push development forward, but also to collaborate and get work between different instances ready in time. In this role, I
      worked a lot on my own, but of course I had collaborate with others in both smaller and larger projects. I also always
      appreciated being able to bounce ideas off colleagues.<br>
      <br>
      I'm looking for an intellectually stimulating workplace where communication, leadership and security are important
      components. With me you'll find a person who is passionate about development, both personally and for the company I am
      working on. I have a talent to see problems from a different angle and find solutions that may not to others be so obvious.
      I'm quick to learn and also love to learn new things. I'm known to be honest, analytical and observant.<br>
      <br>
      Kind regards,<br>
      Karin
